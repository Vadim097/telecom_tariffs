M is a federal mobile operator. The company offers customers two tariff plans: "Smart" and "Ultra". To adjust the advertising budget, the commercial department wants to understand which tariff brings in more money. It is necessary to make a preliminary analysis of tariffs on a small sample of customers. It is necessary to analyze the behavior of customers and draw a conclusion - which tariff is better.

The study tested two hypotheses:
- The average revenue of users of the Ultra and Smart tariffs differ
- The average revenue of users from Moscow differs from the revenue of users from other regions.

In this project was performed a statistical analysis of the data of two tariffs. The analysis of tariffs was made on a small sample of customers. The analysis was based on three categories: calls, Internet traffic and SMS. In the course of the study, the behavior of the operator's customers was analyzed based on a sample: how many minutes of conversation, how many messages and how much Internet traffic is required by users of each tariff per month. The mean, variance and standard deviation were calculated. Histograms were built, distributions were described, and it was concluded which tariff is more profitable for a mobile operator.
